# Implementation-of-suffix-array

Implement a Suffix Array that is capable of performing following operations on Strings in a
most efficient way.
1. Given a string S print its minimum lexicographic rotation.
2. Given an integer K, print the length of the longest substring that appears in the text
at least K times.If no such substring exist, print -1.
3. Given a strings S determine its longest substring that is also a palindrome. In the
case of multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest palindrome.
